# FizzBuzz Kata

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for **multiples of three print “Fizz”** instead of the number and for the **multiples of five print “Buzz”**. 
For numbers which are **multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz“**.

_Sample output:_
```bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
... etc up to 100
```

### Stage 2 - new requirements
 * A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
 * A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
